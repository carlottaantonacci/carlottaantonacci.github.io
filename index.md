# Hello, I'm Carlotta Antonacci

I am a professional translator specialized in **video games, films, and animation**.  
I help companies effectively communicate with Italian-speaking audiences by providing high-quality translations, culturally adapted subtitles, dialogue localization, and content revision.

With a strong linguistic background and experience working with international teams, I ensure that every project maintains its original tone, narrative, and emotional impact while resonating naturally with Italian audiences.
