<h1>Song Translation Project: <em>Sing</em></h1>


<p>
In this project, I translated and adapted two songs from the animated film <em>Sing</em>. 
The adaptations respect the <strong>Penthatlon Principle</strong>, ensuring singability, natural phrasing, and rhythmic consistency in Italian.

<h2>Conference Presentation</h2>
<p>
The project was presented at the University of Turin conference 
<em>"It's not Only Rock'n' Roll: Musica Ribelle"</em>. 
Together with Prof. Vincenza Minutella and my colleagues, we performed and showcased the adapted songs.
