<h1> Night in the Woods </h1>

<p>I translated and localized part of the graphic adventure Night in the Woods (Finji), focusing on conveying the humor, puns, and jokes in order to bring the game's sharp humor to the Italian version as well.</p>

<h1> Wordplays and puns </h1>

<p> In this scene, Mae and Bea discuss the disturbing fact that Mrs. Miranda kept her dead husband in the house, a macabre topic that prompts Mae to produce a series of puns based on idioms and wordplays involving internal organs.

Rather than reproducing these organ-based puns in Italian, my translation shifts toward expressions and wordplays connected to death and funerary imagery, in order to reinforce the theme of the dialogue and preserve its dark, humorous effect for the Italian audience. </p>

<h1> Graphical Elements </h1>

<p> Video game localization often also requires modifying graphic elements such as journals or maps that convey the lore behind the story itself. In the case of NITW, Mae's journal is an element that adds an extra layer of sarcasm and dark humor, and it was necessary to translate and adapt it to provide a complete experience.

Here you can see some of the pages of the journal in both the original and the italian version. </p>
